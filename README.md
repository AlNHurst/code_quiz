# The Coding Quiz Challenge
## Project Description
The Coding Quiz Challenge is an application designed using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The quiz will assess the user's coding knowledge and render a score based on the amount of time remaining at the end of the quiz. 
## Quiz Features
The Coding Quiz has a responsive user interface which is demonstrated in the following features:
* Start button: Clicking the start button will initialize the countdown timer and display the first question. 
* Click responses, event listeners: Clicking a choice will record the response, provide feedback below the question choices, and advance the user to the next question. 
* Built-in conditions: When the response is correct, the user is rewarded with 15 seconds added onto the remaining time. However, when the user answers incorrectly, the user is pentalized and loses 15 seconds from the time remaining. 
* Score Feedback: After the final question, the user is presented with their score and the option to input their initials to save their score to local storage. If the user does not complete the quiz before the timer runs out, the quiz ends and the user is presented with the option to refresh and try again.
* High Scores: The user's score is saved to the High Score ranking. 
* Question shuffle: The shuffle method was added to shuffle the questions for users who want to retry the quiz.
